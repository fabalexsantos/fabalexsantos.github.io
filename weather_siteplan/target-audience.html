            Jhon Rich He would like to go fishing with his family on the weekend. He feels a little insecure, as he
            fears that the weather is rainy and that would hinder his hobby. In addition, Jhon has young children and
            would not like to face serious weather-related problems. His wife does not like fishing, and accompanying
            him on a rainy day could wear out his relationship. For those reasons, the site can help Jhon to have a good
            experience on his weekend.

            Margaret Simons is a principal at a high school. She would like the physical education teacher to create a
            small volleyball tournament with the students. From her experience as a director, Margaret knows that sunny
            days will bring more people to watch the tournament. In the last school event there was a lot of rain and
            therefore few people attended. Through the website, Margaret can consult the days of greatest probability of
            sun, increasing the chances of success of her tournament.

        <h4>
            Scenarios
        </h4>
        <p>I want to go camping for the weekend. Will it be sunny?</p>
        <p>The futsal tournament final is tomorrow! It's cloudy. Will it rain?</p>
        <p>Saturday will be a good day to plan my fishing.</p>
        <p>Next week I am going to walk in the forest. The weather needs to be with because the rain disrupts these
            activities too much.
        </p>
        <p>I'm going to schedule a game for my volleyball team. I would like a sunny day, since the public will attend
            in greater numbers.
